# Iranian-Calendar-Holidays
This is a project for those who need a dataset of Iranian calendar holidays.
I inspired by the "hpez" user and thanks him for his/her deeds. This is his/her repository: https://github.com/hpez/persiancalapi.git .
You can edit start date in line 52.
You can edit number of years to sweep in Line 54.
If a day is holiday for two reasons (national and religous) you can find it in description2 field.
The output contains only holidays.
